# Conversion App Using Razor 

I am continuing my journey in learning about ASP.NET types, and in this project, I decided to explore Razor. 

## Why Razor?
Razor pages are best used for quick, low-overhead pages with few moving parts. Razor is server-side rendered, which means that C# code does not get sent down to the client. Since I have a very simple UI and the overall program logic is structured and simple, Razor pages is the best option.
